### Observations:
- Sampling techniques significantly impact model performance.
- Random Forest performs best with under-sampling.
- SMOTE and SMOTEENN improve performance for linear models.
- NearMiss often reduces accuracy due to aggressive under-sampling.
- No single sampling method is universally optimal.
